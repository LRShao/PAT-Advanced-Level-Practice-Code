A place to store some practice code for PAT(Advanced Level) problem set I wrote in C, which passed the online tests and gained full score. The author is just a newbie in programming so the code is sure to lack elegancy and simplicity and can be improved in many ways, but anyway, this is just for idea-sharing and record :)
