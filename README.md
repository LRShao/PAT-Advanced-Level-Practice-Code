A place to store some practice code for PAT(Advanced Level) problem set I wrote in C, which passed the online tests and gained full score. I am just a newbie in programming so the code is sure to lack elegancy and simplicity and can be improved in many ways, but anyway, this is just for idea-sharing and record : )

Even though these code is written in C, it is still recommended to use C++ (g++ 4.7.2) compiler listed, since it has better optimization and performance in time-sensitive problems.

Below are some solutions (mostly in C++) that I referred to when debugging.
