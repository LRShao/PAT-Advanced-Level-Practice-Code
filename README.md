A place to store some practice code for PAT(Advanced Level) problem set I wrote in C (mostly), which passed the online tests and gained full score. I am just a newbie in programming so the code is sure to lack elegancy and simplicity and can be improved in many ways, but anyway, this is just for idea-sharing and record : )

Some of the solutions use C++ features, e.g. 1052, because I am unable to figure out efficient implementation of some algorithms that can pass all tests within time limit. It is recommended to choose C++ (g++ 4.7.2) as compiler even for pure C code, just for better optimization for time-sensitive problems.

Below are some solutions that I referred to.
